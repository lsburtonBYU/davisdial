  <p class="title-section">2022 saw the release of a wide variety of music across genres, demographics, geographies, and
    levels of popularity.
    Of all the albums I was able to digest this year, these 10 projects showcased the best sonic experience, conceptual
    arc, and lyrical prowess.
  </p>

  <h3>10. Conway The Machine - God Don't Make Mistakes</h3>
  <div class="image-wrapper">
    <img class="img2" src="../images/conway.PNG" width="1009" height="1009">
  </div>
  <p>Buffalo Rapper Conway the Machine follows up 2021’s La Maquina with a gritty, brutal, and unobstructed illustration
    of the cultural calamity Conway has experienced. Despite the dark themes littered throughout the project, Conway
    founds the sonic pallet with semi-sweet piano melodies and his best percussive work to date. Tracks like “Piano
    Love'' and “Drumwork'' showcase such foundations. Many hooks on the project feel reminiscent of an early MF DOOM or
    A$AP Rocky record, but just enough to resonate with the Hip-Hop nostalgia we’ve all been itching to feel again.
  </p>

  <h3>9. Cities Aviv - Man PLAYS The HORN</h3>
  <div class="image-wrapper">
    <img class="img2" src="../images/cities.PNG" width="981" height="981">
  </div>
  <p>In the back alleyways of Hip-Hop’s subgenres lies Cities Aviv, an artist who is consistently surprising. In 2020
    the Memphis underground released a 38-minute, single track album drenched in distorted hooks and flares of jazz
    composition. The same follows for Gavin Mays eighth studio album Man PLAYS the HORN. The hazy beats, jazz loops, and
    lamentations on how the music industry is affected by the rising prices of buying instruments serves to prove that
    Cities Aviv’s abstract take on modern music is calculated and precise. There’s a certain charm to Mays’
    idiosyncrasies. Whether it’s his moody tag “One” prefacing most tracks or his choppy, mind massaging production
    cuts, you can’t help but lean into the peculiarity. The album’s intimidating 26 track length quickly melts into a
    single piece–you find yourself at the closing track much quicker than expected, ready to absorb it all over again.
  </p>

  <h3>8. Kendrick Lamar - Mr. Morale &amp; The Big Steppers</h3>
  <div class="image-wrapper">
    <img class="img2" src="../images/kendrick.PNG" width="989" height="989">
  </div>
  <p>Legendary M.C. Kendrick Lamar follows a 5-year hiatus from 2017’s DAMN with new themes, ideas, compositions, flow,
    and textures. It seems that Kendrick’s longest gap between albums revealed a greater depth in his chosen thematic
    pallet. Sexual assault (“Mother I Sober”), transgender awareness (“Auntie Diaries”), communication toxicity (“We Cry
    Together”), family trauma (“Father Time”), and sobriety are just a few of the intimate and sobering tones Lamar
    pours into the piano-soaked sonic experience. The double-album isn’t short of ideas or material–in moments the theme
    seems too large to really absorb thoroughly. While the tracklist, stylistic change, and vulnerability is certainly
    intimidating, it is the very existence of that intimidation that puts the album on this list. Finishing this album
    feels different from any other Kendrick project, yet you’re left with the feeling that this project marks an
    important milestone in Hip-Hop history.
  </p>

  <h3>7. Broken Bells - Into The Blue</h3>
  <div class="image-wrapper">
    <img class="img2" src="../images/brokenbells.PNG" width="1007" height="1007">
  </div>

  <p>In an era with the Alternative genre on the decline, James Mercer of The Shins and legendary producer Danger Mouse
    have consistently risen above the odds. Their now three-album discography includes Broken Bells (the debut) After
    The Disco, and now Into The Blue. After three albums, Mercer and D.M. are focused–The style has shifted from
    irresistibly catchy dance-alt hooks to slower, more thought-out reflections on mental health, the state of the
    world, and how to navigate it all. However, don’t let the idea of “slower” trick you into thinking “less
    interesting”. Into The Blue showcases the duo’s most nuanced and beautiful songwriting to date. With Mercer asking
    “Did I do my part?” on Love On the Run, the answer is yes–you certainly did your part with one of the best albums of
    2022.
  </p>

  <h3>6. Beach House - Once, Twice, Melody</h3>
  <div class="image-wrapper">
    <img class="img2" src="../images/once.PNG" height="1001" width="990">
  </div>
  <p>It almost goes without saying that Victoria Legrand and Alex Scally know their way around an atmospheric groove.
    Yet, on TheNeedleDrop, the duo admits that they felt unworthy of incorporating strings into their music–until now.
    With their first double-album, Once, Twice, Melody is an extravagant, indulgent, and decadently atmospheric
    4-chapter experience. Few groups have released a double-album in the manner that Beach House have, and the method
    has allowed proper time for proper digestion. The issue with double albums often lies in the sheer magnitude of the
    project, and Beach House has turned 85 minutes into 4 separate experiences. While the themes and sound is supposedly
    sequential and purposeful, the experience is the same on shuffle as it is top-to-bottom. Despite this, the tracks
    stand firm. The opener and title track feels ornate and refreshingly different from their previous work on the
    songwriting front. Each subsequent track reveals that Beach House is no longer hiding their desires in low-pass
    filters and drowned out guitar passages, rather they’re highlighting even the highest frequencies of their
    instrumental palette, with overlapping vocal harmonies, acoustic guitars, and reverberated string ensembles.
    Thematically, the album tells a tale of feelings gained, shared, lost, and the existential wisdom gained through it
    all. With Victoria lamenting in the closing chapter that it Hurts To Love, you can’t help but sit back, run your
    hands through your hair, and agree.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Danger Mouse &amp; Black Thought - Cheat Codes</h3>
  <div class="image-wrapper">
    <img class="img2" src="../images/cheatcodes.PNG" width="995" height="995">
  </div>
  <p>Cheat Codes begs an important question: How can a project be simultaneously glittery and massively gritty?
    Top-to-bottom, Danger Mouse and Black Thought deliver the answer with shockingly groovy hooks and consistently good
    verses from names such as Raekwon, Joey Bada$$, A$AP Rocky, and even MF DOOM, which is a faith-restoring sentiment
    to posthumous work. And of course, Tariq “Black Thought” serves as a competent duo to the production’s father.
    Danger Mouse, contrary to his work on Broken Bells, clings to piano, sampled strings, and the drum loop for dear
    life–yet it rarely (if ever) grows tiresome. “The Darkest Part”, “Because”, and “Cheat Codes” are evidence of this
    stylistic approach. It’s no wonder that these tracks are among the standouts on the record. After 35 minutes of MF
    DOOM-esque hip hop grit, grime, and hammering shine, the album closes with a reworked sample of Tony Joe White’s
    “For Le Ann”, which serves as a sentimental and beautiful foundation for Tariq’s closing remarks. It’s the kind of
    album where you (generously) spin the volume knob up and roll the windows down, temporarily freed by a carefree
    state of being. Cheat Codes meets and exceeds expectations–an immediate modern classic.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Black Midi - Hellfire</h3>
  <div class="image-wrapper">
    <img class="img2" src="../images/hellfire.PNG" width="1001" height="1001">
  </div>
  <p>At this point, a studio mix is a concept quite familiar to the common listener. From coffee shops to kickbacks,
    midnight drives to basement ear-blasts, music follows the rules. Black Midi, however, are an exception–perhaps THE
    exception. On Hellfire, the London outfit achieves a feat of musical-melting unprecedented and unparalleled. Is it
    jazz? Is it cabaret? Post punk? A mixture? Nobody really knows–which is why this album is an ever-giving,
    ever-changing, kaleidoscopic sonic experience that is very, very good. Okay, but is that it? What about the
    standard, “human” aspects of an album?
    Thematically, Hellfire greatly expands on the thoughts echoed on Cavalcade. Yet there’s a lightheartedness to it
    all. “Sugar/Tzu” world builds a boxing match from the 80’s, with all the chaos and excitement that ensues from
    such an event. On “Welcome To Hell”, frontman Geordie Greep strips the honor from war, claiming “To die for your
    country does not win a war, To kill for your country is what wins a war” with an aggressive, almost violent
    instrumental to complement the sentiment. “Still” slings you back to the 70’s with a floydian meander through a
    story that complements the era. There are moments of manic, near-the-edge vocal behavior, and there are moments of
    thoughtful, wise contemplation. So, what gives? It’s an album of worldbuilding, shocking (yet compelling),
    transformative experiences that are simultaneously fun and harrowing, chaotic and melodic, and undoubtedly the
    greatest display of original instrumental prowess the 21st century has seen. See for yourself: On the first
    listen, you’ll likely dismiss it entirely. On the fourth, you’ll be purchasing tour tickets to witness the sheer
    brilliance of Black Midi.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Black Country, New Road - Ants From Up There</h3>
  <div class="image-wrapper">
    <img class="img2" src="../images/ants.PNG" width="980" height="980">
  </div>
  <p>There are two kinds of mind-bending: One can be explained by the previous record, Hellfire. But the other kind is
    a bit trickier to describe. It’s like staring at an optical illusion—there is definitely something going on that
    you can’t fully comprehend. Some turn away, dissatisfied. Others keep looking until its secrets can be uncovered.
    Black Country, New Road have done just that on their sophomore record, Ants From Up There. Isaac Wood and co.
    return from their experimental alt-art-pop-rock debut For The First Time with even more alt-art-pop-rock, except
    this time, the boundaries are pushed even beyond the expansive debut. There’s this familiar flavor the harmonic
    dish engenders. Unlike friends and co-tourer Black Midi, who thrive on chaos layered with more chaos, BCNR thrives
    on perception. A surface level listen of the vocal melodies and string/horn ensembles is not dissimilar to
    something you’d hear off a Father John Misty record. But underneath the shallow mix you might hear at a grocery
    store(though let’s be honest, will that ever even happen anyway?)is a whole atmosphere of darkness, dissonance,
    and tension. It’s neither simple nor pleasant to listen to, especially if you’re REALLY listening. It’s an
    experience best fit for a deep dive—but don’t be scared—you’ll probably like what you find in this
    heart-wrenching, anthemic, and gorgeous project. Loving this thing won’t be easy, however—it’s a love that’s
    earned.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Weyes Blood - And In The Darkness, Hearts Aglow</h3>
  <div class="image-wrapper">
    <img class="img2" src="../images/weyes.PNG" width="978" height="978">
  </div>
  <p>Here’s the thing: Natalie Mering’s 4th studio album, Titanic Rising, is one of the best albums of the past
    decade. Every track oozes with folk-psych melodies as sticky as a pot of honey, and the themes ride the line
    between “cringe” and “based” flawlessly.
    So how is Natalie supposed to follow such a groundbreaking and profound project? It wouldn’t necessarily be
    tasteful for her to return with a second copy of Titanic Rising(though she certainly could), and she’s seen that.
    Weyes Blood returns with a 5th extension of the alias, which is a 10-track helping of sonic despair—a dish served
    glowing. It begins with wise remarks about a new wild-west: A social jungle post-pandemic. Earlier in the year,
    Arcade Fire tried(and failed) to remark on the mental alienation existent today. Weyes Blood succeeds. In a world
    plagued (literally) by social, mental, physical, and public health crises, the themes may beg, “Is there any point
    to it all, anyway?”, In The Darkness, Hearts Aglow is the middle-finger to nihilism we all desperately needed. The
    soaring melodies fly high, for the production on this record is even better than Titanic Rising. But, is the album
    better than its predecessor? The truth is, Titanic Rising gave us something to believe in, and In The Darkness,
    Hearts Aglow gave us a reason to live. You decide (Meanwhile, I’m going to go turn into a flower).
  </p>

  <h3>1. Djo - Decide</h3>
  <div class="image-wrapper">
    <img class="img2" src="../images/djo.PNG" width="1000" height="1000">
  </div>
  <p>You’re probably wondering why a celebrity’s side pop project made number one on this list, besting some of the
    most legendary and experimental projects of 2022. There’s a very real (and valid) stigma when it comes to
    celebrities making music. Would Joe Keery’s alias “Djo” have the platform it has without Stranger Things? Would
    this album even be considered for this list if it weren’t for Joe Keery’s famous hair fans go crazy for? Was
    Keery’s work in Post Animal enough? Truth is, it doesn’t even matter, because Decide is a top-to-bottom sonic
    masterpiece deserving of the accolade as the best album of 2022. The album opens with a mind-massaging synthetic
    sequence on “Runner”, which continues to build with synth sequences and some of the most delicious production of
    the year. Joe’s vocals have improved since the debut, with a more present and focused role in the studio mix. The
    track descends into chaos and seamlessly transitions into “Gloom”, an 80’s punk murmur on social anxiety—a
    thoroughbred nose-wrinkle of a track. “Half Life” has weird passages which juxtapose one of Keery’s finest
    choruses to date(and the best synth-solo of the year). The midpoints of the record are unpredictable, yet totally
    invited. “On and On” is a punctual reflection on social media addiction—the first to properly do so since MGMT’s
    “TSLAMP”. “Climax” feels like a procreation of Daft Punk’s “Instant Crush” and Kavinsky’s “Nightcall”, which is a
    welcomed sentiment considering the 80’s influence. Themes of personal change, identity discovery, greed, and
    finding solace in the human condition reveal that Joe Keery is actually serious about this whole music thing, and
    he isn’t selling out, either. The center passage in “Go For It” is enough to pitch your local Walmart into an
    identity crisis. The album cascades to the closing track, “Slither”, which is the best song of the year. Two
    things are evident after the 2-minute opus comes to a mic-drop close of “We all wanna be someone at the end of the
    day”: Joe Keery can actually make music, and Decide is a replay masterpiece in a single-play world, worthy of all
    the critical praise it’ll never get.
